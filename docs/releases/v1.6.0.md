# Disaster Recovery Core Module version 1.6.0

Welcome to the latest release of `dr` module of [`SIGHUP
Distribution`](https://github.com/sighupio/distribution) maintained by team SIGHUP by ReeVo.

With the Kubernetes 1.20 release, it became the perfect time to start testing this module against this Kubernetes
release. Minor works have been done in the AWS terraform module.

  - Kubernetes 1.19 is considered stable.
  - Add tech-preview support to Kubernetes 1.20.

`terraform` project. No further action is required.
