# Velero Node Agent

Velero supports backing up and restoring Kubernetes volumes attached to pods from the file system of the modules.
The data movement is fulfilled by using [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) and [Kopia](https://github.com/kopia/kopia), both are Open Source backup tools.
This support is considered beta quality due to a list of [limitations](https://velero.io/docs/v1.12/file-system-backup/#limitations).
